From great quality essentials to stand-out style across womenswear, menswear and kidswear, plus our beauty, homeware and accessories, there is something for everyone at Generic Online Shop. Fuelled by creativity and a true passion for what we do, we are constantly innovating to create design-led fashion and everyday essentials, at wallet-friendly prices.

                Our online store sit at the centre of who we are as a business. We are always thinking one step ahead adding new and exciting in-store services such as beauty and food and drink outlets to create true retail destinations. Digital plays an increasingly important role in sharing our story and engaging our customers. We have over 24m fans engaging in our content across our social channels and we’re rolling out a brand new customer website across our markets, showcasing a much bigger range of what we sell and providing customers with availability by store.

                Affordability has always been at the heart of Generic Online Shop. Our vision now is to make more sustainable fashion affordable for everyone. We’re focused on giving our clothing a longer life, protecting life on the planet, and improving the lives of the people who make our clothes. That’s why we’ve set out to change the way our clothes are made with our Generic Online Shop Cares strategy, a wide-reaching programme of commitments we’re working to achieve by 2030. This includes ensuring our clothes will be made from recycled or more sustainably sourced materials; halving carbon emissions across our entire value chain; and pursuing a living wage for workers in the supply chain. Already over a quarter of all of our clothes are more sustainable, which customers can find in store by looking for the green heart of the Generic Online Shop Cares label.
